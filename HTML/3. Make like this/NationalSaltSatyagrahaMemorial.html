            <b> About The Location</b>: The "National Salt Satyagraha Memorial"
            or "Dandi Memorial" located in Dandi, Gujarat, India, is designed as
            an experiential journey that recreates the spirit and energy of
            Mahatma Gandhi's 1930 Dandi March. Visitors are guided step-by-step
            through the monument to help them envision and comprehend the
            history of the famous Dandi March and the Satyagraha approach, which
            ultimately resulted in gaining India's independence from British
            colonial rule. <br /><br />

            <b>History</b> : There have been many liberation movements around
            the world, but none quite like the Dandi March. In 1930, Mahatma
            Gandhi made the decision to oppose the British Government's stance
            on the salt tax. Mahatma took the high road of non-cooperation. He
            started a 390-kilometer trip from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi with the
            assistance of 80 marchers. Thousands of people came to show their
            appreciation along the path. He imparted to them the virtues of
            truth and non-violence. By taking a pinch of salt when they finally
            arrived in Dandi, they rocked the British Empire and sent a message
            for India's independence that reverberated throughout the world.

            <b>About Location</b> : UNESCO has included Dholavira of Kutch in
            the list of World Heritage Sites in 2021, giving Gujarat the
            opportunity to shine once again on the World Heritage Map. With the
            inclusion of Dholavira in the World Heritage Site, Gujarat has also
            got the pride of being a state with four World Heritage Sites.

              >Dholavira is the larger of the two most remarkable excavations of
              the Indus Valley Civilization or Harappan culture, dating back to
              4500 years ago.</strong
            >While the other site, Lothal, is more exhaustively educated and
            easier to reach, a visit to Lothal only complements, rather than
            replaces, a visit to Dholavira. What this site offers you, in the
            intense environment that comes with being surrounded by the Great
            Rann of Kutch, is a unique insight into the pioneering Harappan
            mind, with one of the world’s earliest and best planned water
            conservation systems and what might be the world’s first signboards,
            written in ancient Indus script. <br /><br />

            The excavation also tells the story of the 7 stages of the
            civilization, from development to maturity to decay, the last of
            which hints at a strange piece of history, with more questions than
            answers. After the peak of the civilization Dholavira was
            temporarily abandoned, after which it seems that the settlers
            returned with a markedly de-urbanized culture. There are hints that
            they willingly chose to simplify their lives, rather than try to
            ride the collapse of their once glorified civilization. Here, on the
            ruins, you will have a chance to contemplate what progress and
            civilization mean and what, if anything, is truly permanent.
            <br /><br />

            <b>Background</b>: Dholavira, known locally as Kotada (which means
            large fort), sprawls over 100 hectares of semi-arid land at the
            north-west corner of the island of Khadir, one of the islands in the
            Great Rann of Kutch that remain above the flood-plains in months
            when the rest of the desert is submerged by the monsoon. Dholavira
            has two seasonal nallahs, or streams: Mansar in the north, and
            Manhar in the south. The journey to Dholavira itself is beautiful,
            taking you through the saline desert plains of the Great Rann, where
            you can spot wildlife such as chinkara gazelle, nilgai (blue bull,
            the largest antelope in Asia), flamingos and other bird life.
            <br /><br />

            The site was unearthed by the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) in
            1967, but has been systematically excavated only since 1990.
            Artifacts include terracotta pottery, beads, gold and copper
            ornaments, seals, fish hooks, animal figurines, tools, urns, and
            some imported vessels that indicate trade links with lands as far
            away as Mesopotamia. Also found were 10 large stone inscriptions,
            carved in Indus Valley script, perhaps the world’s earliest
            signboard. These are among the most important discoveries about the
            Indus Valley Civilization, but remain tantalizingly undeciphered.
            <br /><br />

            The remains show an imposing citadel in the center, with a middle
            and lower town, each fortified separately, built with pleasingly
            smoothed structures of sun-dried brick and stone masonry, and with
            remarkable town planning. Well laid out lanes lead outward
            systematically from the citadel, with a well-constructed underground
            drainage system for sanitation. There is a large stadium with a
            complex structure and seating arrangement. <br /><br />

            Finally, Dholavira has one of the world’s earliest water
            conservation systems ever excavated. Satellite pictures show a
            reservoir underground, an expertly constructed rainwater harvesting
            system extending from the walls of the city, without which the
            settlement would not have thrived in the sparse rainfall of the
            desert. <br /><br />

            <b
              >Dholavira is one of the two largest Harappan sites in India, and
              5th largest in the subcontinent</b
            >: Like Lothal, it passed through all the stages of the Harappan
            culture from circa 2900 BC to 1500 BC, while most others saw only
            the early or late stages. <br /><br />

            The excavation found a decline of the civilization in the 5th of 7th
            stages, after which were signs of a temporary desertion of the site.
            Settlers returned later in the late Harappan stage, with a change in
            their pottery, influenced by cultures found at sites in Sindh, South
            Rajasthan and other parts of Gujurat, but they did not bring the
            return of the civilization. Their houses, for example, were built in
            an entirely new form that was circular (bhungas), and the material
            signs were strikingly deurbanized and simplified. Perhaps the last
            stage of the powerful civilization had become aware of its future,
            and was preparing itself for a gradual end. <br /><br />

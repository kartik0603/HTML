          <h2>About Place</h2>

          <p>
            <b>About the Place</b>: A UNESCO Heritage site, Champaner and
            Pavagadh are often clubbed together as one of the most engaging
            historical attractions of Gujarat. Pavagadh stands on top of the
            hill that looks over the sprawl of monuments at the base in
            Champaner. The duo makes a rich heritage site dotted with forts,
            mosques, monuments, tombs, arches, temples, step-wells and
            fortresses from 8th to 14th century. Today, throngs of pilgrims
            ascend Pavagadh to worship at the important Kalikamata Temple,
            dedicated to the goddess Kali, who sits atop the summit. Champaner
            is the only unchanged Islamic-Mughal city over the centuries,
            offering an authentic flavour of architecture of the era. Juxtaposed
            to this is the Kalika Mata Temple on the Pavagadh Hill, where
            thousands congregate during Navratris. <br />
            <br />

            At the heart of Champaner, is the Citadel, whose most impressive
            features are its 16th-century monumental mosques (no longer used for
            worship), with their beautiful blending of Islamic and Hindu
            architecture. The huge Jami Masjid, just outside the Citadel’s east
            gate, boasts of a wonderful carved entrance porch that leads into a
            lovely courtyard surrounded by a pillared corridor. The prayer hall
            has two tall central minarets, further superb stone carving,
            multiple domes, finely latticed windows and seven mihrabs (prayer
            niches) along the back wall. <br /><br />

            Other beautiful mosques include the Saher ki Masjid, behind the
            ticket office inside the Citadel, which was probably the private
            royal mosque, and the Kevda Masjid, 300m north of the Citadel and
            about 600m west of the Jami Masjid. Here you can climb narrow stairs
            to the roof, and higher up the minarets, to spot other mosques even
            further out into the countryside – Nagina Masjid, 500m north, with
            no minarets but exquisite geometric carving, particularly on the
            tomb next to it, and Lila Gumbaj ki Masjid, 800m east, on a high
            platform and with a fluted central dome. The twin minarets
            resembling factory chimneys, about 1 km west, adorn the Brick Minar
            ki Masjid, a rare brick tomb. <br /><br />

            <b>Brief History</b> : Pavagadh became the capital of the Chauhan
            Rajputs around 1300, but in 1484 was taken by the Gujarat Sultan
            Mahmud Begada, after a 20-month siege; the Rajputs committed jauhar
            (ritual mass suicide) in the face of defeat. Following his capture
            of Pavagadh, Sultan Mahmud Begada turned Champaner, at the base of
            the hill, into a splendid new capital. But its glory was brief: when
            it was captured by Mughal emperor Humayun in 1535, the Gujarati
            capital reverted to Ahmedabad, and Champaner fell into ruin.

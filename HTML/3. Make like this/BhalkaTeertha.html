            <p>
                Bhalka Teerth is one of the most magnificent temples of Somnath city. The temple at Bhalka Teerth is known as Mahaprabhuji's Bethak, <br> and a tulsi tree has been planted in Lord Krishna's honour. Banyan trees dot the courtyard of the spectacular Krishna temple that is built in sandstone. <br> Inside the shrine is an unusual idol  of Shri Krishna in a semi-reclining position. The temple also contains a beautiful tribhangi idol of Lord Krishna playing his flute. <br><br>
                <b>Brief History</b> : The temple commemorates the episode when a poacher, Jara, mistakenly hit the Lord with his arrow, thinking itâ€™s a deer. <br> The Lord left for his heavenly abode after this episode, but not before walking 4km from here to Shri Goloknathdham Tirth. <br> In the 9th century AD Shri Vallabhacharya gave discourses on Shrimad Bhagavat Gita here for 9 full days. <br><br>

                <b>Best time to visit</b> : The best time to visit is between November to February, and during Janmashtami.

            <b>About The Location</b> : Ahmedabad had a special relationship
            with Mahatma Gandhi; it was here that Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
            became the man we know as "bapu." Ahmedabad was not only Gandhi's
            first residence when he returned to India in 1915, but it was also
            where he opted to begin the country's freedom war against the
            British. He also made the decision to begin his struggle against the
            ideology of untouchability in the country, as well as the vices
            associated with it. <br />
            <br />

            <b>History</b> : Mahatma Gandhi's relationship with Ahmedabad began
            on May 20, which is a significant occasion in Ahmedabad's history.
            On the above-mentioned date in 1915, Mahatma Gandhi moved into a
            home in Kochrab hamlet, near Paldi, on the outskirts of the city.
            Jeevanlal Desai, a fellow lawyer, and colleague gave him the
            bungalow, which he quickly renamed the Satyagraha Ashram. As a
            result, his first ashram was born, which he completely converted
            into something that stood in stark contrast to everything Ahmedabad
            was at the time. <br />

            <b>About the location</b>: Sabarmati Ashram in Gujarat, located
            north of Ahmedabad, was originally the residence of Mahatma Gandhi
            and his spouse Kasturba. The ashram is flanked by a calm and quiet
            stretch by the Sabarmati River. This is also the location where
            Gandhi started his Dandi March from. Because it was located in
            between a prison and a cemetery, Gandhi believed that a Satyagrahi
            would certainly end his life in either a prison or a graveyard.
            Sabarmati Ashram will reawaken your sense of independence. The
            museum is the most well-known of the many institutions within the
            Sabarmati ashram's grounds. <br />
            <br />

            Various personal letters and images of Gandhi are displayed
            throughout the space. Upasana Mandir, Magan Niwas, Vinoba, Nandini,
            and Kutir are some of the ashram's other structures. The ashram is
            now a historical site, having witnessed numerous historical
            occurrences. You can also visit this place and learn more about
            India's ancient history. <br />

            <b>History</b>: The original ashram was founded in May 1915 at
            Jivanlal Desai's Kochrab Bungalow (approximately 10 kilometers from
            here), who was a barrister associate of Gandhi, as Satyagraha
            Ashram. Mahatma Gandhi required additional space to carry out tasks
            such as farming and animal husbandry so it was transferred to a
            36-acre site on the banks of the river Sabarmati on June 17, 1917.

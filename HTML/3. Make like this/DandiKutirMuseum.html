                <p> <b>About The Place</b> :  Dandi Kutir is India’s largest & only museum built on the life and teachings of one man - Mahatma Gandhi. It represents Gandhi’s powerful idea of people across lines of class, gender, age, and community asserting their common right to salt itself: A symbol to inspire a pluralistic society to march towards independence - Purna Swaraj.  <br> <br>
                
                    A glimpse of Gandhi’s early life is beautifully portrayed with the help of audiovisuals. From his birth on 2nd October 1869 in Kathiawad to his childhood when he was a shy, remarkable and unique student. It also traces his marriage to Kasturba and his experiments with youth.

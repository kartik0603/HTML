          Aavo Padharo, words of welcome in the language of Gujarat because it
          is here that these words ring truly and the guest is 'God' and the
          people of Gujarat are gregariously friendly, inviting and will entice
          you to come again and again. <br /><br /><br />
          Stretches out into the Arabian Sea, with a hint of the desert and with
          a coastline of 1600 kms long is Gujarat – the home state of Mahatma
          Gandhi, the Father of Nation. It is renowned for its beaches, temple
          towns and historic capitals. Wildlife sanctuaries, hill resorts and
          natural grandeur are gifts of Gujarat. Sculpture, handicrafts, arts,
          festivals also make the state rich. Gujarat is also among the most
          technologically advanced, housing the largest petrochemical complex in
          the country. <br /><br /><br />
          Gujarat has always been a major centre for the Jains and some of its
          most interesting locations are the Jain Temple centres at Palitana and
          Girnar Hills. Besides the Jain temples, the state’s major attractions
          include the only habitat of the Asiatic Lions in India (Gir Forests),
          a desert ride at the Wild Ass Sanctuary and the beautiful
          Indo-Saracenic Architecture of Ahmedabad. The colourful tribal
          villages of Kutch make a visit unforgettable.

          <b>About the location</b> : The only real sign of Patanâ€™s former glory
          is this astoundingly beautiful step-well. Located on the banks of the
          Saraswati River, this is one of the oldest and finest stepwells in
          Gujarat and is remarkably preserved. Steps lead down through multiple
          levels with lines of carved pillars and more than 800 sculptures,
          mostly on Vishnu-avatar themes, as well as striking geometric
          patterns. The stepwell is made in the form of an inverted temple. It
          showcases superior craftsmanship of the era, and the unique
          Maru-Gurjara architectural style and houses sculptures similar to the
          Vimalavasahi temple in Mount Abu and Sun temple at Modhera.

          <b>Brief History</b> : The stepwell was built in 1063 by Rani
          Udayamati of the Chaulukya Dynasty to commemorate her husband, Bhimdev
          I. A 1304 composition of Jain monk, Merutunga, mentions that
          Udayamati, the daughter of Naravaraha Khangara, built this stepwell at
          Patan. The same composition also mentions that the stepwell was
          commissioned in 1063 and was completed after 20 years. Archeologists
          Henry Cousens and James Burgess visited it in 1890s when it was
          completely buried under silt and only the shaft and few pillars were
          visible. The stepwell was rediscovered in 1940s, and the Archeological
          Survey of India restored it in 1980s. The stepwell has been listed as
          one of UNESCO's World Heritage Sites since 2014. <br /><br />

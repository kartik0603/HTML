          <p>
            38 km from Vijaynagar, this former princely state lies hugged by the
            Aravali mountain range, which gave it protection from various
            attacks in its history. In addition to some of the larger
            temples,<br />
            look out for the signs of worship of smaller idols scattered up the
            hills. Take the climb up the hill itself, winding through the rocks,
            as a way to share the sacred space in the lives. <br /><br />
            Idar is also a good base from which to get to other sites such as
            Himatnagar, pilgrimage site Khedbrahma, Shamlaji and Dev ni Mori,
            the archaeological site of an unearthed Buddhist seminary, stupas,
            and viharas.

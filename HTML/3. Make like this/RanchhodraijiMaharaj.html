                            <b>General</b> : The main temple, enclosed by a fort wall, is situated near the bank of the holy lake Gomti in the midst of the main bazaar of Dakor. <br> The temple is covered with 8 domes and 24 turrets, with the central dome reaching a height of 27 m. Crowned with a golden kalash and  <br>a white silken flag, this temple is the tallest in the district. Though not very rich in carving, the main cupola derives its influence  <br>
                            from the Maharashtrian style of temple architecture. The main hall features paintings depicting events in Lord Krishna’s life. <br><br>

                            It is believed that Ranchhodji, a name for Lord Krishna meaning "he who left the battlefield", inspired Gopal Jagannath Ambekar, <br> a shroff of a Peshwa’s court in Poona, with a dream to build a vast and magnificent temple. The temple was built in 1772 AD. <br> The main Ranchhodrai idol is in black touchstone, 1 m tall and 45 cm in breadth, richly adorned with gold, jewels and expensive clothes. <br> Its throne, an ornate masterpiece of woodcarving plated in silver and gold, was presented by the Gaekwad of Baroda. <br><br>

                            On the upper floor of the gate there is a tokorkhana (music room) where music is played on shehnai and drums daily every three hours. <br> Shri Bhalchandrarao and other descendants of the builder of this temple, Inamdar Tambekar, give their services to this temple even today. <br> For many, listening to the devotional songs sung by Champavatiben Tambekar is a very special experience.
